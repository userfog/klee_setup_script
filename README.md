# Klee Setup Script

[KLEE](https://klee.github.io/getting-started/) is a symbolic executor which can be used to verify certain properties about code. [Here](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cristic/papers/klee-osdi-08.pdf) is the paper originally published with KLEE.


This script automatically executes the KLEE getting started sequence, so that you can spend less time worrying about how to install KLEE and more time using it.
